### Database Architecture

**Simplified Schema Design:**

```sql
-- Forms table with JSON storage for flexibility
forms {
  id: uuid (primary key),
  title: string,
  description: text,
  fields: json[], -- Array of field configurations
  settings: json, -- Form-level settings (colors, expiration, limits)
  created_at: timestamp,
  updated_at: timestamp
}

-- Submissions table for response data
submissions {
  id: uuid (primary key),
  form_id: uuid (foreign key -> forms.id),
  data: json, -- Key-value pairs of field responses
  submitted_at: timestamp,
  ip_address: string (for basic analytics)
}
```

**Field Configuration Schema:**

```json
{
  "id": "unique_field_id",
  "type": "textarea" | "select" | "radio" | "checkbox",
  "label": "Field Label",
  "placeholder": "Optional placeholder text",
  "required": boolean,
  "description": "Optional help text",
  "options": ["Option 1", "Option 2"], // For select/radio/checkbox
  "conditions": {
    "show_if": {
      "field_id": "previous_field_id",
      "operator": "equals" | "not_equals",
      "value": "trigger_value"
    }
  }
}
```
